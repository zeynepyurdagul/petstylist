I am a married woman with one son and four pets. I dreamed of doing a job related with animals since my childhood; however, when I graduated from Istanbul University, my life shaped in the direction of an academic career. I started working at the human resources department of certain firms. Even when I was working in these firms, I thought about my dream of doing a job with dogs. In my childhood I was really interested with animals, I used to save cats from streets and help dogs etc. Thus, one day I realized that working at a firm is not what I want and working at human resources department kind of helped me figure out what I want. Therefore, I went to Russia to get an education towards my interests and after, I opened a pet stylist saloon in Etiler. In this small business, I would name myself as a dog beauty specialist. With my team, we apply several practices to dogs such as shaving, coloring, spa treatment, and skin care.</p>

    Working with dogs has always been my enthusiasm since my childhood. I feel like they are my child and I take care of them like a mother take cares of her children. I believe that I have a special bond with them.</p>
